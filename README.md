This project is for my final in Harvard cs50 online course.  The purpose is to gather a csv file from a user (web based).  Take that file and split out any rows that contain bad data.  
This originated from a friend that works for a utility company that has the highest standards of enviromental protection
Part of his job is to verify how long trucks are running at the job site and how much wasted energy time.
The csv file he received from the tracking software constentaly has bad data.  I wanted to build a program that split out the good and the bad and then have them available for download to him.
More to come.
